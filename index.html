              It is a long established
              fact that a reader
              will be distracted by
              the readable
              content of a page when looking at its layout.
              The point of using Lorem
              Ipsum is
              that it has a
              more-or-less normal
              distribution of letters,
              as opposed to using 'Content here,
              content here', making
              it look like readable English.
              Many desktop publishing packages
              and web page editors now use
              Lorem Ipsum as their default model text,
              and a search for
              'lorem ipsum'
              will uncover many
              web sites still in their infancy.
              Various versions have evolved over the years,
              sometimes by accident,
              sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
